# Horiseon-Webpage-Project
An on-the-job ticket for a marketing agency looking to make their "codebase" website comply to accessibility standards making. Increasing its usability to more customers and also making it more search engine optimised. Both of whihc will bring more people to their website to benefit from the services of Horiseon

## Installation

This project was a improvemnt on an already started codebase. The original HTML was copied and pasted onto Visual studio (VS); which is what I used to edit and alter the webpage. From this I linked the VS code to a newly created repository on GIT Hub which would enable me to push and update code as i continued. In addition to the HTML code, there was a previous CSS which I built upon to improve the look of the website. Lastly there were some images incorprated into the codebase also provided by Horiseon. The coding editor glitch was also used in the completion of this project as it provided a more familiar debugger than VS.
